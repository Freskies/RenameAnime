<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
	This program change the name of all files in the given directory (and subdirectories)<br>
	according to the following rules:<br>
	all the names are picked up from a file called "names.txt" (one name per line)<br>
	"names.txt" must be in the same directory of the program<br>
	obviously, the number of names must be equal to the number of files in the directory<br>
	("names.txt" doesn't count as a file and is not considered)<br>
	"names.txt" MUST finish with a blank line<br>
	"names.txt" MUST NOT contain any blank line in the beginning or middle of the file<br>
	is ILLEGAL to have a folder with a "." in the name<br>
	Pay attention to the fact that the program will change the name of all the files in the directory<br>
	and subdirectories, so be sure to have a backup of the files you want to keep!<br>
	Enjoy!

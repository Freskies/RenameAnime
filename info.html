<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
	This program changes the name of all files in the selected folder except "name.txt"<br>
	the number of files must be equal to the number of lines in the "name.txt" file<br>
	The file must terminal with a black line<br>
	the files are renamed: "(counter) - (filename from" name.txt "). (extension)"<br>
	THERE MUST NOT BE folders that have "." in their name!<br>
	THERE MUST NOT BE any other files that are not to be renamed!<br>
